# Generation UK
## Data engineering Group Project

This project was comissioned by our client who wants to analyise their metrics from their cafe. They want to figure out what sells the best and at what locations around the UK. They have provided us with multiple CVS which will keep being added automatically in the s3 bucket within AWS. We will use this to create an ETC pipeline along with an EC2 instance to display the data in a graphical way for the client in a dashboard view. 

## Technologies
AWS (S3, EC2, lambda), SQL, Python, GitHub actions.
